# HATE SPEECH DETECTION

The implications of hate speech have received considerable attention from the common public and the society as a whole. There has been a rising concern over the effects of
hate speech and offensive language. However, much of this attention is focused on the critical presentation and evaluation of arguments in favor of and against the ban on hate speech, as opposed to previous conceptual analysis tasks. The general concept of hate speech goes beyond legal texts and sentences, in fact, it goes beyond the legal definition of hate speech. The analysis is done using many well-known conceptual analysis methods that are different from analytic philosophy. The main motive of this analysis is to dispel the myth that evil emotions and malicious rationale are a fundamental part of the nature of human beings. When one is trying to find out a way to combat and deal with hate speech, it is very important to note that it should not be restricted and limited to the use of the criminal law. Hate speech is not bound by the definitions of law and there is every reason to interpret hate speech as an expression. Another thing is that it is not difficult to disprove hate speech, assuming it works effectively to criminalize hate, feelings of hate, and attitudes.
